## Usage
You can apply startpages by using several methods. To keep it simple, I will only cover one (the easiest) here:
1. Download a New Tab Override Plugin (e.g. [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/))
1. Open the Plugins Settings
1. Paste `https://trexxin.github.io/firefox-startpage/` into the text field to set it up as your startpage

## Local Setup
If you do not want to rely on my github page, thats totally okay!
You can set it up locally yourself with the following steps:
1. Switch into the gh-pages branch
1. Download / Clone the repository files
1. Set it up like explained in [usage](#usage), but instead of the link use the filepath to the `/index.html` file.

If you have a github account you can of course also just fork the repo and create a github page yourself ;)


## Offline Setup
If you want a offline copy, I recommend to use the Mini-YAGS export. You can find it in the settings:

After extracting the files from the zip, you can use the `index.html` from there.
 
However. if you don't want to use the Mini-YAGS export for any reason, you will have to use the `gh-pages` branch instead of the `master`. Download the branch files to your computer and open the `index.html`, that should work just fine :)
